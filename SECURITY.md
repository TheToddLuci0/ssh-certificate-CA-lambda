# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version will be actively supported, but you are welcome to open PRs if you need something backported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please use the Security tab on github. You can expect a quick reply, but no SLA given. (Translation: I'm cronically online, but occasionally chronically on airplanes). 

If you wish, you may use my [PGP Key](https://thetoddluc.io/.well-known/gpg.txt) to encrypt the message, but it's by no means required.
